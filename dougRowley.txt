Interest:
I think this is a cool idea. I always struggles finding people who have similar interests to go do certain activites, like basketball. So i think it would be a something I would enjoy working on.

Business:
The business side of the project looks good to me.

Legal:
Dealing with personal information will definitely be a little tricky. I took a cyber security class so I might be able to help a little with dealing with storing personal stuff that needs to be secure.

Techinial: 
I hav a decent amount of experience using android app development, so if we wanted to go that direction front end, I could help a lot there. But I am also willing to learn new stuff. So a different way would be fine as well.
