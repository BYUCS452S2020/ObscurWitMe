I would like to participate in this project because I love the idea of this app. Whether or not there are similar apps in existence, this seems like a fun project to be a part of. Plus, I noticed you wanted someone to do front-end. I’m not the biggest fan of it either, but I happen to need some practice so that would work out great. If there is someone else who is a pro at that, I’ll gladly let them handle it, but I can do it if needed. 

I have experience with NoSQL databases, AWS DynamoDB in particular, and I enjoyed using it. The usage is fairly simple and there is ample documentation to help you get started. I have used MongoDB a little bit, but that was a while ago. My experience with AWS was better than what I remember it being with Mongo, so I would probably go that route. Then again, it has been a while. Thinking ahead, AWS offers other services, such as an API Gateway, to help with the back-end, and I like the simplicity of using them.

I like the idea of a free/premium account and what it could entail. If implemented, the benefits of a premium account could be similar to those of a premium dating app, like you suggested. I hadn’t thought about copyright problems, but maybe there could be a waiver or something that you have to agree to before using the app that says something like “any ideas/content/etc you publish here are not private anymore...” or whatever a legal document would say. I’m interested to see how the matching part with the tags would work, and I would love to help come up with it. Maybe machine learning of some kind? The structure of the matching algorithm interests me as well.
