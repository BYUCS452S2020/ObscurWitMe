= ObscurWitMe

== Description
Users create an account with their general location and become "fans" of a particular piece of media, hobby, or other interest.

ObscurWitMe then attempts to find people with similar interests on the site and bring them in contact. This process would be somewhat automatic, with users able to actively search for other fans of similar interests, but also regular automatic recommendations for people with similar interests.

Users should be able to create pages for an interest if one does not already exist.

Basically dating app meets Facebook group pages minus any romantic aspect.

== Team
I'm looking for two to three to join, preferrably those that enjoy front end (cause I sure don't).

== No-SQL
Some document NoSQL database, probably MongoDB as I've worked with it a little but no strong opinions one way or another.

== Business
Could be made into a premium / free service where only premium users can create pages directly while free users can only suggest pages.

Or premium users are given more power over matching / frequency of automatic matching.

Plus ad revenue is a potential for promoting a particular interest (Sports teams, other interests)

== Legal
Personal information such as location is always a potential pitfall to store.

Potential copyright problems if users are allowed to modify pages and upload content.

== Technical
* Tag matching system with hidden auto-generated tags and public user-defined tags to recommend similar interest areas.
* Ideally a frontend that is portable to an app of sorts, potentially React Native.
* Cron job to run algorithm to find matches for users.
