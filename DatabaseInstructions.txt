You will need to install the developer version of SQL Server from this link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads
Then once that is installed, you will probably want to install SQL Server Management Studio, which can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15
The default server name will be the name of your machine if you didn't change it.
Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to your database by typing in your computer name in the Server Name field.
On the right hand of the screen there will be an object explorer, Expand the top level item, which will be the name of the Server.
Right click on the databases folder and select new database.
For simplicity Sake, use ObscurWitMe as the Database Name, but if you want to use something else it should work fine as long as you change the database.py connection string.
Once you have that database created, Select New Query in the top portion of the management studio
Copy and paste the DatabaseSetup.txt contents into the SQLQuery window that will have opened up after you clicked New Query
Replace TemporaryDatabaseForTesting in the first line with the name of the database, ObscurWitMe if you used that.
Click execute or press F5.
That should run successfully and have set up a database with the correct table structures.
Now the only thing you have to do is change the connection string in database.py to point to your machine.
Change Server=BATTLESTATION to Server= (Your computer's name).
That should do it, but contact me on Slack if you run into any issues.
